    <h3>
      POETRY
    </h3>
    <div>
      <h4>
        Definition
      </h4>
    <p>
      According to Wikipedia, poetry is a form of literary art that uses aesthetic and 
      often rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, 
      literal or surface-level meanings. Any particular instance of poetry is called a poem and is written by a poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poetry has a long and varied history, evolving differentially across the globe. 
      It dates back at least to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa and to panegyric and 
      elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile, Niger, and Volta River valleys.
      Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa occurs among the Pyramid Texts written during the 
      25th century BCE. The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poem, 
      the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in the Sumerian language.

        TYPES OF POEMS
      </h4>
      <H5>
        Haiku
      </H5>
      <p>
        Haiku is a popular form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, which evolved in the 17th century from the hokku, 
        or opening verse of a renku. Generally written in a single vertical line, the haiku contains three sections
        totalling 17 on (morae), structured in a 5–7–5 pattern. Traditionally, haiku contains a kireji, or cutting word, 
        usually placed at the end of one of the poem's three sections, and a kigo, or season-word. The most famous exponent 
        of the haiku was Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694). An example of his writing:
        <br>
        <br>
        富士の風や扇にのせて江戸土産 <br>
        fuji no kaze ya oogi ni nosete Edo miyage <br>
        the wind of Mt. Fuji <br>
        I've brought on my fan! <br>
        a gift from Edo <br>

      <h5>
        Ode
      </h5>
      <p>
        Odes were first developed by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as Pindar, and Latin, such as Horace. 
        Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins.
        The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode.
        The strophe and the antistrophe of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, 
        similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. 
        Odes have a formal poetic diction and generally deal with a serious subject. 
        The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode 
        moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. 
        Example of Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Reflections of Early Childhood by William Wordsworth: <br>
        <br>
        There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, <br>
        The earth, and every common sight, <br>
        To me did seem <br>
        Apparelled in celestial light, <br>
        The glory and the freshness of a dream. <br>

      <h5>
        Elegy
      </h5>
      <p>
        An elegy is a mournful, melancholy or plaintive poem, especially a lament for the dead or a funeral song. 
        The term "elegy," which originally denoted a type of poetic meter (elegiac meter), commonly describes a poem of mourning. 
        An elegy may also reflect something that seems to the author to be strange or mysterious. 
        The elegy, as a reflection on a death, on a sorrow more generally, or on something mysterious, 
        may be classified as a form of lyric poetry.Example of Elegy: O Captain! O Captain! By Walt Whitman, written in 
        memory of Abraham Lincoln:<br>
        <br>
        O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, <br>
        The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br>
        The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
        While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br>
        But O heart! heart! heart!<br>
        O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
        Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
        Fallen cold and dead."<br>
